## Roadmap

There are already plans for hooking this bot up to Firebase to keep track of Twitter username and word blocklists and also to track who's been retweeted and how often. This can probably me automated down the road, but in the beginning, we'll have a page for trusted admins to log in to that will allow them to add to blocklists and perform some moderation tasks. When we've reached that point, there will be an admin application process.
